# Kurt-CoBOT
 A lame Discord bot that matches user messages to Nirvana lyrics then prints them out.

 How to use
    1. Clone the git repository
    2. In this directory create a .env file with the following line of code:
        DISCORD_TOKEN=<insert the discord token here>

I got the Nirvana lyrics dataset from Kaggle in the form of a CSV file and hard-converted
it into a JSON. Then I removed as many songs with profane lyrics as I could. Here is the
link to the original source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darkrubiks/nirvana-lyrics

Prompt engineering with ChatGPT allowed me to use Python data parsing functionality that 
I wasn't familiar with.
